#Hmm so this explains the sudden spike for the increase in total number of cases,
#the increase in municipalities having cases at least one may have led to increase in the total fire cases of all school
#this can also mean that if we control the spread of fire cases to all other municipality, we should be able to slightly control the increase of fire cases.
#We also see the decrease in cases since the suden spike of 2008, we can incur that 
#this could be because of some external effects and government may have taken necessary steps to curb the number of
#fire cases. We will use this information to recommend some municipalities to look after on priority basis and also municpalities 
#from where they can learn and apply the same steps on other municipalities.
#Though this is not enough and we should look for other ways to decrease the total fire cases
